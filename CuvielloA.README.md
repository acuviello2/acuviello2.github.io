## Site 1
https://www.where2eat.com/
- Information is scattered all over the place.
- Very confusing as to what this website is. 
- Poor layout and colour scheme is not consistent.
- Facebook and twitter icons are just floating in the left column.
- Nagivation buttons worked and did take you to the appropiate link but each page continues to provide terrible layouts and confusing design.

## Site 2
http://art.yale.edu/
- Yale school of art website.
- Moving background is very distracting and annoying to look at.
- Not an attractive looking website, poor layout and terrible choice of type. 
- You expect an art school to have a website that’s more appealing to your visual senses than this one.
- The navigation is pretty user friendly but the ghastly use of manga and pop animated backgrounds are enough to put you off.

## Site 3
http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/
- The website is designed for 200 percent zoom, and clicking on the book covers on the homepage does nothing.
- As a matter of fact, there’s a surprise word doc that readers can download containing a list of Children’s Choice Award Nominations.
- I do not understand the point of keeping a downloadable word document when it could easily have been just another page!

## Site 4
http://www.roverp6cars.com/
- The grey and black interspersed with bright red and white makes me wonder if the designer was colorblind.
- This website has no sense of minimalism. 
- The pages are overcrowded with content and low-res pictures, which make browsing a pain.
- Also, the logo on the main page does not match the logo on the rest of the pages.

## Site 5
http://paradisewithaview.com/
- The photos on their home page are various sizes and overlap eachother which makes it very hard to see each picture.
- The fonts become progressively smaller as you scroll down the page.
- The rainbow hues in each level of the content are ugly.
- Flashing texts in fuchsia, non-responsive templates and squat navigation options placed in the middle of the home page will definitely make you rethink about what Paradise is meant to look like.
